I provide my sources as a reference, not as a package for your use. If you
want to use it, just ask kindly and I will probably say "yes". My email is
carl@ript.net.  I am sometimes available on msn messenger via
fromahuman@hotmail.com.

Without my express permission, I do not grant anyone permission to use any
files in my projects in any way other than to just view them.
