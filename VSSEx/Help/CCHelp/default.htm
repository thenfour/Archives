<h1>Welcome to VSSEx by Carl Corcoran</h1>
VSSEx is a lightweight program that supplements Microsoft Visual SourceSafe by extending its commands to the Windows® Shell.
Normally, Visual SourceSafe Explorer has to be running when you need to make check-ins, check-outs, or any other
source control-related operation.  With VSSEx installed, you can perform all of the standard SourceSafe operations
right in Explorer by right-clicking on files or folders!
VSSEx allows you to configure the database to connect to through the use of VSSEx Manager.  Database authentication is
both easy and secure, so there is no added risk to your database.

<h2>Who should use VSSEx?</h2>
Anyone using SourceSafe on a routine basis will benefit from VSSEx.
